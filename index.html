                <p>
                    Pondering is my major activity. I was feel my mind percedes the physical condition of my body and I just couldn't stop observing, thinking,
                    making connections. This, however, is not to say that I enjoy the Cartesian mind-body. On the contrary, I like to chase ambiguity. 
                    Now you might think that as a person website it's time now to show you
                    my skills, my academic path, my projects. Keep exploreing and you'll find more about me.
